            <h1>Time Cop’s Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><b>I neither store nor access your data</b>. I can't, by design. I don't use any third-party services that store or access your data (apart from the app store that you downloaded the app from, but I don't access data from there either).</p>
            <p><em>Time Cop</em> purposely <b>does not</b> include any tracking code, advertising code, or even bug reporting code. It simply isn't there—you can check the <a href="https://github.com/hamaluik/timecop">source code</a> for yourself if you don't believe me, or even take it a step further and compile the source and run the binary without ever touching my binaries. I don't collect your email address, or any other data. The only data available to the <em>Time Cop</em> app is data that you either input directly yourself, or generate through use of the app.</p>
            <p><em>Time Cop</em> collects and generates the following data, and <b>only</b> the following data:
                <ul>
                    <li>Project Names</li>
                    <li>Project Colours</li>
                    <li>Timer Descriptions</li>
                    <li>Timer Projects</li>
                    <li>Timer Start Times</li>
                    <li>Timer End Times</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><em>All</em> data collected and generated by the <em>Time Cop</em> app remains solely in a database on your device until such time as you manually export the data, or some subset of it—in which case, the data you choose to export will be presented to the mobile operating system to be “shared” with whatever app you choose. At no point in this process do I, or any third parties, have access to this data, with the exception of the host operating system and the third party app to which you choose to export the data.</p>
            <p>This policy is subject to change, however in the event of such a change, the <em>Time Cop</em> app will notify you of:
                <ol>
                    <li>The intended changes</li>
                    <li>The reason for the intended changes</li>
                    <li>A date for when the intended changes will come into effect</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>I created <em>Time Cop</em> in my spare time for my own personal use. I find it useful enough that I believe others may find it of value, and so I have made it a public app instead of something I just run on my own device. This doesn't change the value proposition of the app for myself. If I notice that any number of installations have taken place on the app stores, it will make me happy that others find it useful, but it won't change how I treat the app and the data it makes use of.</p>
